Contains all my coding projects from university
The year level is the year I completed it, not necessarily the year level of the unit.

- Brine Shrimp Simulation: 1st yr, Uses pygame and param sweeps
- COVID_Virus_Simulation: 2nd yr, uses python for a graph based simulation with param sweeps
- Elctricity_consumption: 3rd yr, Java project focusing on design patterns
- Flags_Quiz: 2nd yr, Java android project. Focusing on flexibile design
- Island_Builder: 2nd yr, java android project, a sandbox style island builder game. Sprites components were provided
- Kingdoms: 1st yr, Basic Object oriented console project in Java
- Mars_Rover: 3rd yr, Cool project making good use of lots of design patterns. Written in Java
- Multi-Threaded_Disk_Scheduler: 4th yr, multithreaded program in C for hard drive read/write scheduling algorithms
- Programming_Languages: 3rd yr, A lot of small programs in different languages including some toikenisation and lexing!
- SEC: 5th Year, 2 assignments and a couple of the pracs. Both show a further extension on design patterns and multi-threading. One is a multi-threaded robo creater with GUI movement. The other is a Calendar application
- SLPLabels: 5th Year, Some of the code I used for my thesis.
