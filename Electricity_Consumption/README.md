To compile the assignment run the command 'ant' from within the Assignment1 folder

To run the assignment, run the command 'java -jar dist/Assigment1.jar args'

Where args are the approprate command line arguments. If you are unsure what
these arguments are, running the program without arguments will give you a 
description. 
The order of the arguments doesn't matter as long as only 1 input and 1 output 
method are specified and any filenames immediately follow the relevant option

The files in resources are all input files for testing the capability of the 
program to read in a network, they are not all supposed to be valid
